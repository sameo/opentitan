/**
 * ROM enhanced Physical Memory Protection (ePMP) library.
 *
 * The ePMP configuration is managed in two parts:
 *
 *   1. The actual hardware configuration held in CSRs
 *   2. The in-memory copy of register values in `epmp_state_t` that is used
 *      to verify the CSRs
 *
 * Every time the hardware configuration is updated the in-memory copy
 * must also be updated. The hardware configuration is usually interacted
 * with directly using the CSR library or assembly whereas the in-memory
 * copy of the state should normally be modified using configuration functions
 * from the silicon creator ePMP library.
 *
 * This separation of concerns allows the hardware configuration to be
 * updated efficiently as needed (including before the C runtime is
 * initialized) with the in-memory copy of the state used to double check the
 * configuration as required.

 * The actual hardware configuration is performed separately, either by reset

 * to the hardware configuration.
